## Rebase conflicts (exit 3)

`rebase` and `sync` both exit 3 on conflict. `sync` restores every branch to its pre-rebase state first, so a failed `sync` leaves nothing half-applied; a failed `rebase` stops mid-flight and waits.

```bash
gh stack rebase
# exit 3, conflicted paths are listed on stderr
git add <resolved paths>
gh stack rebase --continue     # repeat if the next branch also conflicts
gh stack push
```

`gh stack rebase --abort` restores every branch in the stack, not just the current one. After a failed `sync`, run `gh stack rebase` to recreate the conflict, then resolve and continue.

Because `init` enables `git rerere`, a conflict you resolve once is replayed automatically the next time the same conflict appears. That is common, since a change low in the stack is rebased through every branch above it. Without `rerere`, repeated conflicts may need manual resolution on each affected layer.

## After a squash merge

A squash merge replaces the branch's commits with one new commit, so the originals no longer exist in the trunk's history and an ordinary rebase would try to replay them again.

`gh stack sync` detects this and rebases with `--onto` against the correct target, skipping the merged branch:

```bash
gh stack sync --remote origin
gh stack view --json    # merged branch reports "isMerged": true, "state": "MERGED"
```

No manual action is needed. If the replay conflicts, `sync` restores all branches and exits 3. Run `gh stack rebase` to rerun the rebase, which stops at the conflict so you can resolve and `--continue` until complete. Use `gh stack sync --prune` to also delete local branches for merged PRs.

## Local and remote stacks have diverged

Divergence means the local stack and the stack on GitHub changed in different ways, for example branches were added locally while a PR was added to the stack on github.com.

When non-interactive, `sync` prints both chains, changes nothing, and exits **0** with `Sync aborted`. Success here does not mean the sync happened; check for that message, or re-run `gh stack view --json` and compare.

Two resolution paths:

- **Keep the remote version.** Drop local tracking and pull the stack back down.

  ```bash
  gh stack unstack --local          # keeps the stack on GitHub
  gh stack checkout <stack-number>  # or a PR number
  ```

- **Keep the local version.** Remove the grouping on GitHub, then recreate it from local state.

  ```bash
  gh stack unstack                  # removes the grouping; PRs and branches survive
  gh stack submit --auto --open
  ```

Neither path deletes pull requests or branches. Remote unstacking leaves PRs that are queued or have auto-merge enabled stacked. If needed, clear that state before retrying.

## Restructuring a stack

There is no non-interactive reorder, rename, or removal. `add` run from the wrong branch suggests `gh stack modify`, but that is TUI-only. Tear the stack down and rebuild it instead:

```bash
gh stack unstack                       # removes local tracking and the GitHub grouping
# Rename or drop branches, and rewrite ancestry as needed.
gh stack init --base main branch-1 branch-2 branch-3
gh stack submit --auto --open          # re-link on GitHub
```

`init` adopts branches that already exist, so the rebuild reuses them rather than creating new ones. Existing PRs survive. Once Git ancestry is correct, `submit` updates their base branches and re-links the stack on GitHub. Re-apply `gh pr edit` titles and bodies only if you created new PRs.

Changing metadata does **not** change Git ancestry. Reorder commits first, then rebuild the stack. For example, to change `main <- models <- migration <- ui` into `main <- migration <- models <- ui`:

```bash
old_models=$(git rev-parse models)
old_migration=$(git rev-parse migration)
git rebase --onto main "$old_models" migration
git rebase --onto migration main models
git rebase --onto models "$old_migration" ui
gh stack unstack
gh stack init --base main migration models ui
```

The first rebase moves migration-only commits onto trunk, the second replays model commits above them, and the third replays UI-only commits above models. Preserve the old boundary SHAs before moving any branch. For a different reorder, identify each layer's range with `git log <old-parent>..<branch>`, then replay the ranges bottom to top.

## A PR will not merge

Check in order:

1. Every PR in the merge set, including those below the target, is open, not draft, approved, and green against the stack base's protections and required checks.
2. History is linear. Pushes to a lower branch or a moved trunk break it. Run `gh stack rebase`, resolve any conflicts, then `gh stack push`. The web "Rebase stack" button also works but produces unsigned commits, see `landing.md`.
3. A merge queue is not holding the stack. `gh stack view --json` shows `isQueued`.
4. The failure text from `gh stack merge` or the merge-async `failed` result names the rule.

A merge that stops partway leaves lower PRs landed and the failing PR plus everything above open. Recompute the frontier, fix the failing PR, retry.

## A PR was closed mid-stack

A closed mid-stack PR blocks every PR above it from merging. The stack relationship is kept, so you cannot simply open a replacement. Dissolve and rebuild:

```bash
gh stack unstack                       # drops open, draft, and closed PRs from the stack; merged and queued stay
# reopen the PR, or recreate it from its branch
gh stack init --base main branch-1 branch-2 branch-3
gh stack submit --auto --open
```

Reopening the closed PR before rebuilding is the cheapest path when its branch is intact.

## Branch belongs to several stacks (exit 6)

Commands exit 6 when the current branch cannot identify a single stack, typically because it is the trunk of more than one stack. There is no flag to disambiguate.

```bash
gh stack checkout <a-branch-unique-to-the-intended-stack>
```

Then rerun. Commands that take an explicit stack number (`merge 7`, `unstack 7`) sidestep the problem entirely, since they do not infer the stack from the current branch.

## Driving stacks from another tool or worktree

`gh stack link` creates and updates stacks purely through the API, with no local tracking state. Use it when branches are managed by jj, Sapling, git-town, or another external workflow that does not use gh-stack's local catalog. Linked worktrees themselves are supported: they share `<common-dir>/gh-stack` and do not require `link`.

```bash
gh stack link branch-a branch-b branch-c        # bottom to top
gh stack link --base develop --open a b c       # non-default trunk, ready for review
gh stack link 10 20 30                          # by PR number
gh stack link 7 feature-d                       # append to existing stack #7
```

Because `link` writes no local state, the local navigation commands (`up`, `down`, `top`, `bottom`) will not work on the result. Use `gh stack checkout <stack-number>` if you later want local tracking.

Legacy worktree catalogs are consolidated automatically only when their definitions agree or are disjoint; originals are preserved. On migration conflicts, reconcile the reported source definitions rather than choosing the newest file. Finish legacy operations in their original worktree first, and do not mix old and new gh-stack writers in one clone.

Navigation does not take over another worktree's checkout. Use `--print-path` with an explicit target, check the exit status, and change directory to the quoted output. Only affected clean owners are updated by rebase/sync; commit or stash manually when those owners are dirty. gh-stack does not automatically stash or create/remove worktrees.

For `git init --separate-git-dir` repositories, main invocation and existing absolute/relative `core.worktree` backlinks are supported, including settings in the main `config.worktree`. The discovery caveat is only linked invocation without a main-worktree backlink. A required unresolved main owner produces actionable guidance to run from the main worktree or supply the backlink; unaffected worktrees continue. Never navigate to an administration directory or guess its checkout.

## Stack file is locked (exit 8)

Another `gh stack` process holds either the short catalog lock (`<common-dir>/gh-stack.lock`) or the clone-wide mutation lock (`<common-dir>/gh-stack-operation.lock`). Wait about 5 seconds and retry; read-only views remain available. **Never delete lock files** to bypass coordination. Paused operations are also guarded by shared recovery journals after their process lock has been released. Two agents hitting exit 8 means two topology writers: stop one.

## An interrupted modify session (exit 10)

`gh stack modify` is TUI-only and must never be invoked by an agent. If a repository is left in this state by someone else, restore it:

```bash
gh stack modify --abort
```

Related: `submit` also detects a pending modify state, and under a TTY asks before overwriting the matching stack on GitHub with local state. An unrelated stack cannot consume or clear that journal.

Modify supports stacks distributed across worktrees, but agents must still not launch its TUI. Renames, fold-down cherry-picks, and rebases execute in the appropriate clean owners; only the origin switches for unoccupied branches. Drop/fold sources and their worktrees remain intact. Resolve and stage in the worktree reported by the conflict, then invoke `modify --continue` from any linked worktree. A later conflict can be in a different owner. Abort reverses owner-local renames, restores only operation-touched refs, and deletes only proven operation-created refs, never worktrees. Missing owners, externally changed refs, or save failures retain the journal.
